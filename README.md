# ðŸ§  Cisco Packet Tracer Network Setup

This project involves the design and configuration of a small office network using Cisco networking equipment within Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective is to simulate a functional, secure, and remotely manageable network using a Cisco 2911 router, two Cisco 2960 switches, and four generic PCs.

The network is logically divided into two subnets:

- **Subnet A (192.168.1.0/24)** connects to GigabitEthernet0/0 on the router, linking to Switch0 and PCs PC0 & PC1.
- **Subnet B (192.168.2.0/24)** connects to GigabitEthernet0/1, linking to Switch1 and PCs PC2 & PC3.
- A third interface, **GigabitEthernet0/2**, is configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and reserved for potential WAN/cloud connectivity simulation.
