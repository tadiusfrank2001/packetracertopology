# 📘 Repository: `packetracertopologies`

This repository contains a collection of **Cisco Packet Tracer** projects designed to help reinforce and practice core networking concepts. Each project focuses on different aspects of networking, including:

- 📶 **Network Media** (cables, connectors, physical layout)  
- 💻 **Devices** (routers, switches, PCs, servers)  
- 🔗 **Topologies** (star, mesh, hybrid, etc.)  
- 🧮 **Subnetting & IP Addressing**  
- 🚦 **Routing & Switching**  
- 🌐 **Network Types** (LAN, WAN, VLAN, etc.)  
- 🔐 **Basic Security & Remote Access**  

The goal of this repo is to use **Cisco Packet Tracer** as a hands-on learning environment for developing practical skills and gaining a deeper understanding of how real-world networks are designed, built, and configured.

Each folder includes:
- `.pkt` files (Packet Tracer network simulations)
- A `README.md` with setup details and learning outcomes

> 🛠️ Ideal for students, self-learners, or anyone preparing for Cisco certifications (e.g., CCNA).
