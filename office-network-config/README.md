# üß† Cisco Packet Tracer Network Setup

This project involves the design and configuration of a small office network using Cisco networking equipment within Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective is to simulate a functional, secure, and remotely manageable network using a Cisco 2911 router, two Cisco 2960 switches, and four generic PCs.

The network is logically divided into two subnets:

- **Subnet A (192.168.1.0/24)** connects to GigabitEthernet0/0 on the router, linking to Switch0 and PCs PC0 & PC1.
- **Subnet B (192.168.2.0/24)** connects to GigabitEthernet0/1, linking to Switch1 and PCs PC2 & PC3.
- A third interface, **GigabitEthernet0/2**, is configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and reserved for potential WAN/cloud connectivity simulation.

### üîó Network Segments:

| Subnet        | IP Range           | Devices                              |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Subnet A      | 192.168.1.0/24     | PC0, PC1, Switch0, Router G0/0        |
| Subnet B      | 192.168.2.0/24     | PC2, PC3, Switch1, Router G0/1        |
| WAN Segment   | 192.168.3.0/24     | Router G0/2, Cloud (simulated WAN)    |

| Device Type | Model       | Quantity |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Router      | Cisco 2911  | 1        |
| Switch      | Cisco 2960  | 2        |
| PC          | Generic PC  | 4        |
| Cloud       | Generic WAN | 1        |

## üíª PC Configuration ‚Äì Static IP Addressing

Each PC was manually configured with an IP address in its respective subnet and the default gateway pointing to the router interface on that subnet.

### Example (PC0 in Subnet A):

| Field          | Value             |
|----------------|------------------|
| IP Address     | 192.168.1.10     |
| Subnet Mask    | 255.255.255.0    |
| Default Gateway| 192.168.1.1      |

Repeat with incremental IPs for PC1.

### Example (PC2 in Subnet B):

| Field          | Value             |
|----------------|------------------|
| IP Address     | 192.168.2.10     |
| Subnet Mask    | 255.255.255.0    |
| Default Gateway| 192.168.1.1      |


Repeat with incremental IP for PC3.

## üñß Switch Configuration ‚Äì VLAN 1 Setup

Both Switch0 and Switch1 were configured to allow remote management via VLAN 1 and secured access:

### Switch0 Example:

```bash
enable
configure terminal
hostname Switch0
banner motd # Unauthorized access is prohibited. #
# you can use your own secret password
enable secret Sw1tch0Secret! 
service password-encryption
# you can use your domain name
ip domain-name tadiuslab.local
interface vlan 1
# the host ID of the router can be anything within 2-9 and 12-254 ranges
ip address 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0
# now we can implement our config
no shutdown
exit


ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1

# Set up console security
line console 0
password c0nsol3Sw0
login
logging synchronous
exit
# Set up VTY
line vty 0 4
password vtySw0Pass
login
transport input all
exit
end
# startup our config so our switch operates with our configs
copy running-config startup-config
```

Apply a similar configuration for Switch1 using the `192.168.2.x` range, I utilized `192.168.2.100` to keep it similar.
