# üß† Cisco Packet Tracer Network Setup

This project involves the design and configuration of a small office network using Cisco networking equipment within Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective is to simulate a functional, secure, and remotely manageable network using a Cisco 2911 router, two Cisco 2960 switches, and four generic PCs.

The network is logically divided into two subnets:

- **Subnet A (192.168.1.0/24)** connects to GigabitEthernet0/0 on the router, linking to Switch0 and PCs PC0 & PC1.
- **Subnet B (192.168.2.0/24)** connects to GigabitEthernet0/1, linking to Switch1 and PCs PC2 & PC3.
- A third interface, **GigabitEthernet0/2**, is configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and reserved for potential WAN/cloud connectivity simulation.

### üîó Network Segments:

| Subnet        | IP Range           | Devices                              |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Subnet A      | 192.168.1.0/24     | PC0, PC1, Switch0, Router G0/0        |
| Subnet B      | 192.168.2.0/24     | PC2, PC3, Switch1, Router G0/1        |
| WAN Segment   | 192.168.3.0/24     | Router G0/2, Cloud (simulated WAN)    |

| Device Type | Model       | Quantity |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Router      | Cisco 2911  | 1        |
| Switch      | Cisco 2960  | 2        |
| PC          | Generic PC  | 4        |
| Cloud       | Generic WAN | 1        |

## üíª PC Configuration ‚Äì Static IP Addressing

Each PC was manually configured with an IP address in its respective subnet and the default gateway pointing to the router interface on that subnet.

### Example (PC0 in Subnet A):

| Field          | Value             |
|----------------|------------------|
| IP Address     | 192.168.1.10     |
| Subnet Mask    | 255.255.255.0    |
| Default Gateway| 192.168.1.1      |

Repeat with incremental IPs for PC1, PC2, PC3 in their respective subnets.
